This includes possible rent, personnel, office and communication costs, travel expenses or advertising expenses.\nExcessive administrative costs are not only harmful to the image of a non-profit organization. It is expected that as much of the funds as possible go directly to the purposes supported. There are also upper limits under tax law which, if exceeded, threaten to result in the withdrawal of charitable status. For charitable organizations that are predominantly financed by donations, the Federal Fiscal Court has defined an upper limit of 50% for administrative costs. For clarification. In order to receive the DZI donation seal, an organization's advertising and administrative expenses may not exceed 30 percent of its total annual expenses, and we adhere to these guidelines."
