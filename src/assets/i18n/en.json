After we started in early 2009 with the first school in a pilot project (12 snacks daily) and were able to gain experience, our concept is currently accepted by 33 schools / daycare centers in the cities of Aachen, Alsdorf, Brühl, Eschweiler, Herzogenrath, Cologne and Stolberg. We supply around 1,100 children here every day. \n \nEarly in the morning, long before school starts, several hundred break sandwiches are cut, greased, lovingly topped, hygienically packed and delivered to the elementary schools / daycare centers by other helpers before classes begin. There, the break sandwiches are distributed to the schools / daycare centers, to the individual classes under their own direction. This ensures that all children can have breakfast at break time. \n \nThe demand is reported by the school management to the association, which provides and delivers the corresponding sandwiches free of charge. The helpers do not find out who in the class receives a breakfast4kids sandwich, because no child should feel excluded. The positive side effect of not being hungry is that the children can concentrate better, are more active and communicative, and also learn to share. \n \nA small snack with a big effect. A hearty breakfast is the perfect start to the day. Above all, it gives children the necessary strength and energy to master the challenges of the school day. With a good breakfast and a full belly, they \"simply feel better,\" are more concentrated at work and perform better. However, more and more schools are reporting that many of their students often come to school without breakfast. \n \nFacts: \n \nChildren not bringing breakfast to school or daycare can have a variety of causes. Some children are left on their own in the morning, guardians don't have time or there is simply a lack of money. \n \nOur goal: \n \nOur goal is to feed as many children as possible with a healthy breakfast in the schools. With your help, we can currently guarantee over 1,100 children a snack for at least 1 school year. If necessary, we would like to reach even more children and provide them with a healthy snack.",

This means: It makes a lot of sense to get involved in climate protection across national borders and to finance the saving and reduction of CO2 elsewhere.\n\nIn concrete terms, this means that we often reinvest part of the wealth we have generated. For every euro invested, more greenhouse gases can be saved in emerging or developing countries than would be possible with the same amount in Germany. In addition, we promote prosperity and social participation in these countries in line with the 17 sustainability goals of the UN Agenda 2030. However, the overriding goal must remain local CO2 avoidance - one planet for all, all for one planet.\n\nAll of us in Wuppertal should use resources responsibly and avoid unnecessary CO2 emissions. But what can we do in addition?

Create with us a new center for a free, lively and diverse scene in and for Karlsruhe. Support our cultural work with your donation.\n\nWho is behind the project?\nFor more than ten years, Panorama e.V. has been committed to an open and creative cultural scene in and for Karlsruhe. With projects such as \"Halle 14\" and \"P8\", the non-profit association has already supported independent and non-commercial projects and events in the past. Many artists had their first performances there, many people organized their first concerts and exhibitions there. We want to continue this engagement and create a new place, with more space and new possibilities.\n\nWhat are our goals?\nCurrently, a large number of cultural areas in Karlsruhe are threatened by demolition and buyout. We want to make a long-term and affordable replacement possible for at least some of those affected. We want to continue to work with many people for a lively and diverse cultural scene. After a long search for a new cultural area, we finally have reason to rejoice: The independent cultural scene is getting a new home in Karlsruhe-Bulach! On almost 3,000 m² of space, we are creating a place for creative ideas and people: with large event spaces, two open-air areas as well as 15 rehearsal rooms, 12 studios and more space for cultural and artistic initiatives in the city.\n\nWhy do we need your support?\nWe want to show that art and music are colorful and diverse, connect people and creativity enriches everyday life. In the coming weeks, we need to expand the existing spaces and create new ones for this purpose. For the new center, this will create well-equipped and affordable spaces for over 150 creative people. Together we are building on the foundation of open cultural access for all and the joint shaping of the local cultural scene. The opportunity is favorable and unfortunately rare: Space for culture has unfortunately often fallen by the wayside due to economic interests. Be part of building a long-term and creative arts and culture center! \n\nWhat happens with the money in case of successful support?\nWe use all donations to create the framework for a new, uncommercial and diverse cultural center to support creatives and cultural workers. To promote access and participation for all, to shape a cultural scene in and for Karlsruhe that is critical of discrimination.
